# Implementing Surface Nets inÂ Godot
This is a repo sharing my implementation of the Surface Nets algorithm in Godot. I wrote an article on Medium walking through my implementation process.

## Project Structure
* /common - contains some of the common nodes that I used throughout the project
* /figures - contains scenes for each of the Figures in the Medium article I wrote
* example_scene.tscn - a simple example scene
* surface_net.gd - my basic implementation of the Surface Nets Algorithm

## Usage
This code is under the MIT License which should let people do almost anything they want with this project. Not required, but if you end up using it please reach out to me and let me know, I would love to know this is being used.
